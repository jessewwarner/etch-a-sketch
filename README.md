# etch-a-sketch
This project is to create a webpage that acts like an etch-a-sketch. 
The goal is to allow a user to pick a square grid of up to 100x100 div
elements that change color when a user mouses over it.

This project will require the use of all the skills that were taught in
The Odin Project up to this point and possibly addition knowledge that 
will be searched for using Google.
